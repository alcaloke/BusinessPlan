        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The aim is of this development plan is to build a prototype interface for <strong>Phoneticon</strong>; a new
            platform for next-generation digital communication. The prototype interface will feature sufficient
            functionalities to give the users a taste of creating <i>audiovisual texts</i>, or, <i>phoneticons</i>.
            The main purpose of Phoneticon is to provide a new way of text messaging on digital devices, where the
            expressivity of the textual content is expanded beyond the choice of font types; to the mediums of
            audiovisual and motion graphics.</p>
        <p>By expanding the expressivity of the digital text, the users will be able to create and send messages that
            convey more complex meanings; by adding emotional contents to the text. The current text messaging
            platforms have incorporated emojis, GIFs and other visually oriented elements, as well as, audio
            messaging to expand the user's ability to express beyond the limitations of text. Phoneticon approaches
            the limitations of written language to carry emotional contents by adding audiovisual and motion
            graphical elements to the text.</p>
        <p>By using Phoneticon as a medium for communication, we believe that the users will be able to develop and
            enhance their creativity, sensibility and empathy. When creating a phoneticon, it is required to
            visually format, sonically shape, and, control the motion of the text message based on the user's conceptual
            and
            emotional contents; where his/her ability to <i>think</i> creatively, <i>feel</i> for
            sensibility of aesthetics, and <i>intuit</i> the emotions to empathise are essential.</p>

        <h2>Prototype Technology</h2>
        <p>The prototype interface will only feature functionalities that enables the user to create audiovisual texts,
            or, phoneticons. At this early stages of the development, the aim is to showcase the potential of Phoneticon
            as a tool for expanding the creative and empathetic expressivity of text.</p>
        <p>The interface will be built for the chrome browser using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The browser canvas will
            display the visual elements, while the Web Audio API will control the audio effects. The p5.js library will
            serve as the backbone for all graphical processing. JavaScript’s native DOM (Document Object Model) will be
            used to for text inputting.</p>

        <h2>Technology Development Strategy</h2>
        <p>The fully functional Phoneticon application will be built for the desktop and mobile devices. It
            is critical to have a development strategy for the underlying technologies that will run the Phoneticon app.
            Appropriate technologies for digital communication such as WebSocket or any other communication protocols,
            as well as, JavaScript based server environment such as Node will be developed and integrated into the
            Phoneticon interface.</p>
        <p>It would be helpful for now to designate the interfacial aspects of Phoneticon as: <i>frontend</i>, and, the
            server side aspects as: <i>backend</i> technologies.</p>
        <p>The best approach at this stage is to focus on the frontend technologies without the peer-to-peer
            communication functionalities. It is critical to first demonstrate that phoneticons work as eligible
            messages
            that can be read, and, function as an alternative medium to text with wider expressivity.</p>
        <p>Once the motivating concepts have been proven to work, the development for the integration of the server-side
            and
            the communication protocol technologies can begin. When this milestone has been reached, it may be
            necessary to bring in outside expertise to work on the backend technologies. This will be discussed further
            in <a href=”#collabStrat”>Collaboration Strategy<a>.</p>

        <h2>Collaboration Strategy</h2>
        <p>In order to bring Phoneticon to the market, it is absolutely necessary to collaborate with experts in various
            fields to integrate the appropriate frontend and backend technologies. There are three options for
            collaborating: 1. Hiring programmers; 2. Entering an accelerator programme, and 3. Meeting a mentor in
            person. Each options have their own pros and cons.</p>
        <p>Hiring programmers and other experts in their fields would provide greater control over how the Phoneticon
            app is developed. However it is necessary to consider whether I have the best vision and management skills
            with regards to developing a consumer ready app. Also, to be able to hire, I would still require funding.
        </p>
        <p>Entering an accelerator programme would provide me with the funding, some level of technical expertise, as
            well as mentorship to guide the development process. However, it seems that most accelerator programmes are
            designed for companies with a structured team already in place. Also I am less attracted by the fast paced
            and business as usual attitude of start-up environments.</p>
        <p>Meeting a mentor who understands my vision & character, and, who is able to provide personalised advice would
            be ideal. Before I fully immerse myself into this journey, I must be certain about what I am actually good
            at, and, the kind of environment in which I want to work in.</p>
        <p>It is clear that I am good at working with ideas; able to fuse multiple concepts to create an entirely new
            vision. Such skill is an inherence of intuitives who are sensitive to aspects of reality that are not so
            obvious to other types. It is the ability to recognise how particular qualities of reality are related to
            each other. However such nature of intuitives make them over-sensitized in busy and fast paced environments.
            Also an intuitive is not so capable when it comes to working with actual details of reality; rendering them
            rather disorganised and disarrayed under pressurised and attentive circumstances.</p>
        <p>Considering both my expertise and blind spots, it would be best to find a mentor who believes in my vision,
            and, understands the way I work so that an environment suitable for the development can be co-produced.</p>
