        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The aim is of this development plan to build a prototype interface for <strong>Phoneticon</strong>; a new
            platform for next-generation digital communication. The prototype interface will feature sufficient
            functionalities to give the users a taste of creating <i>audiovisual texts</i>, or, <i>phoneticons</i>.
            The main purpose of Phoneticon is to provide a new way of text messaging on digital devices, where the
            expressivity of the textual content is expanded beyond the choice of font types; to the mediums of
            audiovisual and motion graphics.</p>
        <p>By expanding the expressivity of the digital text, the users will be able to create and send messages that
            convey more complex meanings; by adding emotional contents to the text. The current text messaging
            platforms have incorporated emojis, GIFs and other visually oriented elements, as well as, audio
            messaging to expand the user's ability to express beyond the limitations of text. Phoneticon approaches
            the limitations of written language to carry emotional contents by adding audiovisual and motion
            graphical elements to the text.</p>
        <p>By using Phoneticon as a medium for communication, we believe that the users will be able to develop and
            enhance their creativity, sensibility and empathy. When creating a phoneticon, it requires the users to
            visually format, sonically shape, and, control the motion of the text message based on the users’
            conceptual and emotional content. This requires the users’ ability to <i>think</i> creatively,
            <i>feel</i> for sensibility of aesthetics, and <i>intuit</i> empathetically the emotions that the users
            want to convey.</p>

        <h2>Initial Technology</h2>

        <p>The prototype interface will only feature functionalities that enables the user to create audiovisual texts,
            or, phoneticons. At this early stages of the development, the aim is to showcase the potential of Phoneticon
            as a tool for expanding the creative and empathetic expressivity of text.</p>
        <p>The interface will be built for the chrome browser using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The browser canvas will
            display the visual elements, while the Web Audio API will control the audio effects. The p5.js library will
            serve as the backbone for all graphical processing. JavaScript’s native DOM (Document Object Model) will be
            used to for text input.</p>
